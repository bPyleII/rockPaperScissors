# rockPaperScissors
This rock-paper-scissors game will be my first implementation of the foundatins of JavaScript. The progam will use functions, conditionals, loops, and logic to play the game. The game will be created to run in the browser through the console and will put the user against the computer. Later, I will use HTML and CSS to create a GUI for the game.
